Alexa:
For my part of the project I worked on adding a slider to scale the selected shape and a drop down to change the color of
the selected shape. A challenge I found when creating the slider was that when I originlly set the scale and moved the slider,
the shape would become large very quickly and take up the whole screen. I had to adjust the max value in order to get a more gradual
scale change. Also, I set the min to 0 originally which caused the shape to disappear altogehter so I changed the min to 1.
As for creating the color drop down, I found this to be more difficult and it took more time for me than the slider. I used a choicebox
to add various colors as well as the default color of lightgray, because I found that once you clicked a color choice there was no way 
to go back to the default color if I didn't add it as a selection. I considered using a button that led to a listview to change the color
but I found that using a choicebox looked cleaner when added to the subscene. At first I struggled with registering the event but I used 
nested if and else if statements in order to change each color only when each shape was selected. I know that using nested statements
isn't the cleanest and fastest way to go about the choicebox; however, I faced roadblocks when trying to find other ways. 

Sean:
For my part, I made the subscene and the button to add shapes. I added the ability to choose a box, sphere, or cynlinder. The tricky part was for the menu to change when you selected the different shapes. For example, for a sphere, there is no height, width, etc. But for a box, there is a setting for those, but there is no setting for radius. And for a cylinder there is a radius and a height. There is also a setting for translating and scaling initially when you create a shape. I also added the background color changer for the subscene - but Alexa had written that code for the shapes so it was easy for me to copy that over for the background.
